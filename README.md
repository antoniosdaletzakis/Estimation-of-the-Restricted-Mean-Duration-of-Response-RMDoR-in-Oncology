Abstract
The duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from the onset of response to treatment up to progression of disease or death, whichever occurs earlier. While DoR is a useful measure of efficacy in oncology, its estimation is challenging due to right-censoring in clinical trial data. The restricted mean duration of response (RMDoR), defined as the expected DoR restricted to the interval 
[

[0,œÑ], is often used as an alternative.
This paper investigates the behavior of RMDoR as a function of

œÑ and compares estimators for RMDoR under different methods for handling interval censoring, using extensive simulation studies in single-arm and randomized controlled trial settings.
